## Study of the Ising model critical temperature and phase transitions

We will be simulating the Ising model using the Metropolis method, a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. 
Our goal is to find the critical temperature of the Ising model in order to study its phase transitions and magneitzation.

We will be implementing the 2D lattice version of the Ising model, using a 2x2 case as our analytical solution. 
We increase the lattice size eventually and run for multiple Monte Carlo cycles.




Compile: 
```
make compile
```

Run example:
```
make run L=10 mc_cyles=10
```

This is a test to push from Leahs mac.
